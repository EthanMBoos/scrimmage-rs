# Writing Rust plugins

Use [PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md](PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md) for the SCRIMMAGE design.
This document maps that design to the current Rust API; it does not redefine
the original documentation or claim that every legacy service is ported.

For engine navigation, see [SOURCE_LAYOUT.md](SOURCE_LAYOUT.md). Category
interfaces live in named framework modules; concrete built-ins
live only under `crates/core/src/plugin/<category>/`. The public authoring
imports remain `scrimmage_core::plugin::*`; the source moves do not require
changes to an external plugin project.

## Seven extension points

| Type | Owned by | Built-in implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Autonomy | Entity | [Straight](../crates/core/src/plugin/autonomy/straight/straight.rs) |
| Controller | Entity | [SimpleAircraftControllerPID](../crates/core/src/plugin/controller/simple_aircraft_pid/simple_aircraft_pid.rs) |
| MotionModel | Entity | [SimpleAircraft](../crates/core/src/plugin/motion/simple_aircraft/simple_aircraft.rs) |
| Sensor | Entity | [NoisyState](../crates/core/src/plugin/sensor/noisy_state/noisy_state.rs); [NoisyPosition](../crates/core/src/plugin/sensor/noisy_position/noisy_position.rs) (Rust-only illustration) |
| Interaction | Simulation | [SimpleCollision](../crates/core/src/plugin/interaction/simple_collision/simple_collision.rs) |
| Network | Simulation | [LocalNetwork](../crates/core/src/plugin/network/local_network/local_network.rs), [GlobalNetwork](../crates/core/src/plugin/network/global_network/global_network.rs) |
| Metrics | Simulation | [SimpleCollisionMetrics](../crates/core/src/plugin/metrics/simple_collision_metrics/simple_collision_metrics.rs) |

Each implementation is an ordinary struct containing its own state and model code.
No plugin author needs to implement the engine's erased adapters, manage
threads, take locks, or edit the simulator.

Inside the engine, each category has its own constructor catalog and typed slots.
Updates call the stored plugin directly; there is no all-category instance enum
to check each tick. The internal forwarding traits remain, and the public
plugin traits and registration methods are unchanged.

## Where to put your model code

For growing autonomy implementations, see
[Fighting autonomy plugin bloat](FIGHTING_AUTONOMY_PLUGIN_BLOAT.md). It describes
ordinary component and state composition without adding another plugin framework.

Every built-in follows the same layout: imports and configuration, owned state,
`impl Plugin`, the category implementation, private helpers, then tests. Read
the category's `step` first to understand the algorithm; `configure` explains
how mission parameters reach it. See [Rust style](RUST_STYlE.md#familiar-plugin-authoring)
for the layout and ownership rules.

These are the seven working patterns; the linked built-ins above contain the
actual code rather than a second set of templates to keep synchronized:

| Category | What belongs in its update | Regression coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Autonomy | Read current state/observations, calculate desired commands, write ports. | Straight configuration test; aircraft missions; seven-category contract test. |
| Controller | Read desired/current state, run owned control loops, write actuator commands. | Named XML gain mapping and PID equation tests; aircraft missions. |
| MotionModel | Read actuator commands, integrate owned model state, update mutable truth. | Level-flight equation test; aircraft and substep missions. |
| Sensor | Read committed truth, construct a measurement, apply effects, queue output. | NoisyPosition zero-noise/bias and fixed-seed draw-order tests; sensor visibility contract. |
| Interaction | Inspect world entities, apply physical effects, emit events. | Straight collision/removal mission; same-tick interaction/metrics contract. |
| Network | Decide reachability and delivery for each link through `context.route`. | Built-in delay validation; local/global routing and custom delay/loss tests. |
| Metrics | Subscribe during initialization, consume events during step, report team totals. | Team aggregation unit test; mission summaries; independent subscriber contract. |

The engine supplies short-lived contexts; do not store them in the plugin.
Store only the plugin's own persistent model state and configuration. A motion
model is allowed to update truth, while a sensor borrows truth read-only.
Messages and observations must follow their documented delivery paths.

For C++ developers: the plugin struct holds what used to be class members;
`impl Plugin` supplies common lifecycle operations; `impl Sensor` (or another
category) supplies the specialized update. This is composition through traits,
not a duplicated inheritance hierarchy. `Result<Update>` distinguishes an
operation failure (including numerical failure) from an applied or stop-requesting update.

Straight uses a named configuration struct. LocalNetwork and GlobalNetwork are
stateless and use `Config = ()`; configuration still rejects unsupported delay modes.
Call `configure` and pass its result to `new`. The controller parses legacy
`[P, I, D, integral band]` XML values into named `PidGains`; angular PID updates
still use radians and convert the legacy degree-valued band once at construction.

Downstream plugins can import `Pid`, `PidGains`, `EulerAngles`, `Quaternion`,
`Vec3`, and `rk4` directly from `scrimmage_core`. Use `Quaternion::from_euler`
for attitude construction and `rotate_body_to_world` to rotate vectors.

## Add a plugin

1. Use the built-in for your category as a reference. Add the ported plugin's
   named `<plugin>.rs` implementation and XML defaults under
   `plugin/<category>/<plugin>/`. Declare and re-export it in the named category
   module, following the example below.
2. Implement `Plugin::configure` to parse and validate XML parameters into a
   typed configuration. Implement `Plugin::new` to construct independent
   mutable state for each instance.
3. Implement your category's `step`. Use optional `initialize` for initial
   state and subscriptions, and `Plugin::close` for shutdown.
4. Register the type with `register_autonomy`, `register_controller`,
   `register_motion`, `register_sensor`, `register_interaction`,
   `register_network`, or `register_metrics` in `plugin_manager/builtins.rs`
   for a bundled plugin.
5. Reference that registration name in the mission.

[builtins.rs](../crates/core/src/plugin_manager/builtins.rs) shows all seven
registration categories. Missions select the registered names:

```xml
<entity_interaction>SimpleCollision</entity_interaction>
<network>GlobalNetwork</network>
<metrics>SimpleCollisionMetrics</metrics>
<!-- Autonomy, controller, motion_model, and sensor belong inside entity. -->
```

Start with `PluginRegistry::with_builtins()` and add your project types.
A bare `PluginRegistry::default()` is deliberately empty; it must also register
the `GlobalNetwork` used by simulator events. As in C++, the mission gets an
implicit GlobalNetwork when it does not explicitly list one.

The public registry is still covered by
[plugin_contracts.rs](../crates/core/tests/plugin_contracts.rs). Its supporting
models are test fixtures, not a separate application or a prescribed project
layout. The intended later top-level application API is described in
[LIBRARY_FIRST_REFACTOR.md](LIBRARY_FIRST_REFACTOR.md) and remains deferred.

## Plugin files and defaults

Each built-in has one directory containing its implementation and defaults:

```text
crates/core/src/plugin/motion/simple_aircraft/
    simple_aircraft.rs   # Rust struct, configuration, and motion equations
    SimpleAircraft.xml   # SCRIMMAGE mission-facing defaults
```

This folds C++'s separate header/implementation and XML directories into one
Rust plugin directory. All seven categories follow this layout. The small
category file `plugin/motion.rs` loads it explicitly:

```rust,ignore
#[path = "motion/simple_aircraft/simple_aircraft.rs"]
mod simple_aircraft;
pub use simple_aircraft::SimpleAircraft;
```

The path is relative to the category file. The logical module remains
`plugin::motion::simple_aircraft`, and the public type remains
`scrimmage_core::plugin::motion::SimpleAircraft`. No extra wrapper module or
duplicate implementation is needed. Keep category interfaces in named framework
files such as `motion.rs`, and registrations in
`plugin_manager/builtins.rs`; neither belongs in the model equations.

`SCRIMMAGE_PLUGIN_PATH` directories are searched first, in order, followed by
`crates/core/src/plugin` under the supplied repository root. Search is recursive;
the first `PluginName.xml` found wins. XML defaults are overlaid by `param_common`
values, then mission attributes. A registered type without a defaults XML file
uses the fallbacks in its `configure` implementation.

For an external plugin, keep `PluginName.xml` beside its Rust module and put
that directory on `SCRIMMAGE_PLUGIN_PATH`. Registration and public imports are
unchanged. This only discovers XML: custom code must already be compiled into
the caller and registered there; the stock command does not load user Rust crates.

The ported C++ plugins retain their mission defaults, including `<library>`
metadata. Rust currently selects the registered type by the mission's plugin
name; it does not load that C++ library. Plugins are linked as Rust code;
runtime shared-library loading is intentionally out of scope. NoisyPosition has
its own Rust-example defaults and is not a C++ sensor port.

Only implemented plugins ship defaults here. Reference headers, build files,
schemas, and unported plugins remain in sibling `../scrimmage`, branch
`Ubuntu-24.04`; do not recreate a parallel reference tree in this repo.

## Control signals and state

`Plugin::ports` declares named input/output channels with units and frames.
The engine validates connections before execution and supplies `PluginIo`
to autonomy, controller, and motion updates.

```text
Autonomy outputs -> Controller chain -> MotionModel inputs
```

See `SimpleAircraftControllerPID` for desired heading/altitude/speed inputs
and throttle, roll-rate, and pitch-rate outputs.
Autonomies/controllers receive read-only state; motion receives mutable truth.
Interactions receive the entities after motion and sensors, and can update
physical state or health. Structural creation/removal remains engine-owned.

`AgentContext.state` reads the entity's owned belief, falling back to read-only
truth when no sensor has installed an estimate. Sensors call
`context.set_belief(state)` with an owned value or `context.clear_belief()` to
restore ideal feedback. Both autonomy and controllers use this same state.
Motion still writes truth; frames, physical interactions, and explicitly named
`contacts_truth` still expose truth. This does not hide the world from every
legacy autonomy: it removes mutable truth aliasing from the belief path.

Belief persists between sensor samples. Multiple sensor writers execute in XML
order; the last update wins. This is not sensor fusion. Sensor initialization
runs before motion, controllers, and autonomy, matching C++'s initialization
order. During simulation, sensors still sample after all motion substeps; the
next autonomy/controller phase sees the updated estimate.

### NoisyState

`NoisyState` ports the legacy own-state noise equations and XML parameters.
It detaches initial belief, then samples post-motion truth, updates belief, and
publishes `StateWithCovariance` on `LocalNetwork`. Straight prefers the newest
delivered message; when none arrives, it uses current belief. The PID reads
belief directly, not the network queue. Delaying/dropping LocalNetwork messages
therefore does not delay the direct belief update.

Include `<network>LocalNetwork</network>` when using Straight or NoisyState.
Straight now subscribes to local state messages even when no sensor publishes.
Missing configured networks remain errors; they are not silently created.

Legacy details retained deliberately:

- Each `pos_noise_0..2`, `vel_noise_0..2`, and `orient_noise_0..2` value is
  `mean standard_deviation`, in meters, meters/second, and radians respectively.
- Attitude noise right-multiplies body-axis roll, pitch, and yaw rotations.
- The C++ message leaves angular velocity zero and covariance equal to a 3x3
  identity matrix. That covariance is **not** a calibrated sensor uncertainty.
- Samples use the existing Rust per-sensor RNG, keyed by mission seed, entity
  ID, and sensor instance. Draws interleave position/velocity per axis, followed
  by roll/pitch/yaw, including zero-noise draws. This is not C++ RNG-sequence parity.

Try `missions/noisy-state.xml`. Its two aircraft have independent sensor streams.
The separate `verification/noisy-state-bias.xml` fixes standard deviations at
zero to compare the retained equations and feedback against C++ independently
of random-number generation. NoisyPosition remains a distinct Rust illustration.

## Messages

Each plugin instance owns independent subscriptions, an incoming queue, and an
outgoing queue. Message data is shared immutably for multicast, not plugin state.
The following excerpt uses the `Population` message and `ExampleNetwork` from
the plugin contract test fixtures, not names registered by the stock command:

```rust
// initialize:
context.messages.subscribe::<Population>("ExampleNetwork", "population")?;

// publisher step:
context.messages.publish("ExampleNetwork", "population", Population { entity_count: 8 })?;

// subscriber step:
for message in context.messages.receive::<Population>("ExampleNetwork", "population")? {
    self.entity_samples += message.value.entity_count;
}
```

Receive explicitly drains this subscriber's delivered queue at its update;
it does not drain anyone else's queue. This is the Rust equivalent of processing
messages in the step body, not a claim that C++ callback registration is ported.
Each message includes sender identity, publication time, and actual delivery time.
Wrong message types and unconfigured network names are errors.

Queues have fixed message-count limits in `pubsub/messages.rs`: 1,024 outgoing
publications per plugin, 1,024 unread messages per subscriber/channel, and 65,536
pending deliveries per network (including fan-out staged in the current phase).
Overflow returns an error and terminates the run with normal cleanup; it is not
silent loss or backpressure. A failing phase is not rolled back. These are simple
research defaults, not byte limits or legacy queue-policy compatibility. Drain
subscriptions you create; a deliberately slow subscriber can fill its own queue.

A network implements `step` and calls `context.route` once. Its decision
function receives sender/receiver identities, topic, time, and world contacts,
then returns `Delivery::Drop` or `Delivery::After { delay_s }`.
Zero delay delivers during the current network phase; positive delay waits
until a later phase, even if the publisher goes silent. A network can use its
own mailbox through `context.messages()`.

LocalNetwork connects plugins on the same entity; GlobalNetwork connects all
endpoints. The source's nonnegative `comm_delay` queue semantics and stochastic
delay are not ported by these built-ins and are rejected explicitly.
Custom networks have the explicit delay/loss behavior above.

`SensorContext::publish_local` is a separate convenience for latest-value
entity-local observations. It bypasses simulated network policies; use the
message API when communication behavior matters.

## Execution and lifecycle

```text
Generate entities
-> all autonomies
-> all controller substeps
-> all motion substeps
-> sensors
-> interactions
-> networks / delivery
-> metrics
-> remove inactive entities
-> output / advance time
```

Entity phases join all worker tasks before the next phase. Cross-entity reads
use committed snapshots. Interactions, networks, and metrics run on the
coordinator; plugin state is never shared mutably between workers.

Interactions also run once before the first tick, matching the reference.
Networks run in name order. Metrics can consume interaction messages within the
same tick; autonomy cannot see post-motion sensor deliveries until its next step.
Autonomy/controller/sensor loop rates retain outputs when updates are skipped.
World-level plugins run each phase as in the C++ reference source.

Return `Update::Applied` or `Update::Stop`; use `Result::Err` with an explanation
when the operation failed, including nonfinite model state. A normal plugin stop
finishes the current tick, including networks and metrics, then emits terminal
state. This is an intentional Rust contract, not C++ early-exit equivalence.
Removal occurs after that tick's delivery/metrics; removed entities receive no
later messages, including already scheduled deliveries. Pending future messages
are not flushed at termination. `EntityPresentAtEnd` is written to the event log
during finalization, not delivered as an extra metrics/network phase.
Close is called once on removal, terminal completion, failure, or dropping the
simulation. Close errors/panics do not prevent other plugins from closing.
Initialization failure also closes every constructed plugin in that entity;
`close` must tolerate incomplete initialization. Ordinary `Result` failures name
the responsible plugin; caught panics may have only phase/entity context. Do not
rely on recovery from an aborted process or a panicking constructor.

Metrics return a `MetricReport` containing ordered headers and per-team values
and scores. Multiple metrics instances are supported. CSV output sums team
scores and qualifies duplicate column names with the plugin instance identity.
`Simulation::metric_reports()` exposes each report separately.

## What remains

See [MODEL_SCOPE.md](MODEL_SCOPE.md) for the selected aircraft, world, and waypoint
models, their options, and deliberate limits. [EVIDENCE.md](EVIDENCE.md) provides
runnable checks. [TODO.md](TODO.md) lists current priorities. Legacy delay
behavior, additional sensor models, and plugin debug
geometry need further work. Readiness, services, runtime parameters, and
callbacks should be implemented where selected models/integrations need them,
not copied as an unconditional framework backlog.

Compiled downstream Rust plugins remain supported. Runtime shared-library
discovery/loading and legacy protobuf/string-map spawning are explicitly excluded.
Burn and optional ROS 1/2 and ArduPilot adapters are future work, not current
capabilities. JSBSim is planned only as offline flight-model reference tooling,
not a production plugin or FFI integration. XML/template coverage is partial;
a YAML frontend and typed runtime spawn requests are not implemented.
